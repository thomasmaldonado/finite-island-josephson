The repository's main file is finite-island-josephson.ipynb, which employs Python and Mathematica (the latter required due to the use of the Wolfram Client Library for Python) to generate all of the figures in the paper "Quantum theory of the Josephson junction between finite islands," soon to be published in _Physical Review Letters_ by Maldonado et al. The Jupyter Notebook also generates the paper's four main analytical formulas: the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility in both the Cooper pair box and transmon regimes. These formulas incorporate approximations described in the paper to yield finite-island corrections to standard observables in circuit quantum electrodynamics.
