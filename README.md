The repository's main file is finite-island-josephson.ipynb, which employs a combination of Python and Mathematica code to generate all of the figures and main analytical formulas in the paper "Quantum theory of the Josephson between finite islands" published in _Physical Review Letters_ by Maldonado et al. Employing the approximations discussed in the paper, these analytical formulas yield finite-island corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility in both the Cooper pair box and transmon regimes.
